    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date</strong>: [Insert Date]</p>
    <p>
        At <strong>Chasing Nostalgia</strong>, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, 
        and safeguard your information when you use our application. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users directly. Our application interacts with third-party services, 
        such as Instagram, to fetch publicly available data. The information we access includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Instagram Posts</strong>: Captions, media URLs, timestamps, and other publicly available data from selected Instagram accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Instagram Usernames</strong>: The Instagram usernames of vendors whose posts are displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>
        The data fetched from Instagram is used solely for displaying vendor posts within our application. We do not store, process, or share 
        this information beyond the scope of this application.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        We do not store any personal data on our servers. All data is fetched dynamically from Instagram during the user's session and is not 
        retained or cached.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our application relies on the Instagram API to fetch and display vendor posts. We do not have control over Instagramâ€™s data policies, 
        and users should refer to Instagram's own privacy policy for more information.
    </p>
    <h2>5. User Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not store personal data, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete within our application. Users who wish to 
        manage their data should do so directly through their Instagram account settings.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory 
        reasons. Any updates will be posted on our <a href="https://your-github-page-link">GitHub page</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
